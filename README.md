# SEmu-Fuzz

SEmu-Fuzz is a fuzzing extension of SEmu. It was developed as part of our paper ["What Your Firmware Tells You Is Not How You Should Emulate It: A Specification-Guided Approach for Firmware Emulation"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3548606.3559386) at CCS 2022. SEmu-Fuzz is based on [Unicorn Engine](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn) as ISA emulator and intergrate [AFL](https://github.com/shandianchengzi/afl-unicorn) or [AFLplusplus](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus) as the fuzzing engine. Taking advantage of Unicorn API, we could sync all peripheral access (mmio and dma r/w) to with SEmu peripheral model. SEmu peripheral model is used to check, execute and chain the [extracted condition-action rules](https://github.com/MCUSec/SEmu) at runtime.

## installation

**Note:** If you meet "Core dump" when installation, use `pip freeze` to determine your dependency.

### Docker Installation (Recommend)

The installation of AFL/AFLplusplus will fuzz your local unicorn environment, so Docker is recommended.

1. Use `ubuntu_install_docker.sh` to install docker command.
2. Build docker by `dockerfile`, run:

    ```
    ./build_docker.sh
    ```

3. Run docker in bash:
    ```
    ./run_docker.sh
    ```
4. Start to use `semu-fuzz` and `semu-fuzz-helper`!

### Local Installation

The dependency of `SEmu-Fuzz` is very minimal, and it can be installed directly on your local machine. All you need to do is install it using `pip` and choose your preferred `AFL`.

We also provide a script which covers installation.

Ubuntu >= 20, just run (Recommended Python >= 3.8):

```bash
./install_local.sh
```

Ubuntu < 20, please run the following script to fix the dependency of angr and AFLplusplus:

```bash
./install_local_ubuntu18.sh
```

This script has 3 functions:
1. Create a virtual environment named `semu`;
2. Add command `semu-fuzz` and `semu-fuzz-helper` for use.
3. Install [AFLplusplus](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus).

When you need raw [AFL](https://github.com/shandianchengzi/afl-unicorn), just change the link and dirname in [install_local.sh#L30-L31](./install_local.sh#L30-L31) or [install_local_ubuntu18.sh#L50-L51](./install_local_ubuntu18.sh#L50-L51), and run it again.

**Note:** the original AFL has many issues, such as mistaking `semu-fuzz` as a shell script, making it impossible to perform fuzzing tests. To address this issue, we also provide a [modified AFL](https://github.com/shandianchengzi/afl-unicorn) with some configuration changes.

If you don't need AFL, please just use `pip` to install:

```bash
cd </pathto/SEmu-Fuzz>
pip install .
```

## Usage

After installing this package, two command line instructions, `semu-fuzz` and `semu-fuzz-helper`, will be added. For specific usage instructions, add the `-h` parameter.

Note: If you install this package in virtualenv, please run `workon semu` before use.

### semu-fuzz

```bash
usage: semu-fuzz [-h] [-s STAT] [-d DEBUG_LEVEL] [-l INSTR_LIMIT] input_file config_file
```

You can use `semu-fuzz -h` for the details.

`semu-fuzz` is a command-line tool designed for fuzz testing that utilizes the SEmu peripheral model to simulate the execution of mutated input files. The tool requires two positional arguments: `input_file` and `config_file`, which specify the path to the mutated input file and the configuration file of the test case for emulation, respectively.

For more information about the configuration file, please refer to the [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

In addition to the required arguments, `semu-fuzz` provides several optional arguments that can be used to customize the behavior of the tool. These include:

- `-h` or `--help`: Displays the help message and exits.
- `-s STAT` or `--stat STAT`: Stat new blocks created by input file in a dir.
- `-d DEBUG_LEVEL` or `--debug_level DEBUG_LEVEL`: Specifies the level of debug information printed during execution, with a range of 0 (disables debug) to 3 (maximum debug).
- `-l INSTR_LIMIT` or `--instr-limit INSTR_LIMIT`: Specifies the maximum number of instructions to execute. The default is 30,000,000, and setting the limit to 0 disables it.

### semu-fuzz-helper

```bash
usage: semu-fuzz-helper [-h] [-a] [-s] [-t DURATION] {config,launch,stat} base_configs
```

You can use `semu-fuzz-helper -h` for the details.

`semu-fuzz-helper` is a command-line utility that provides additional functionality to `semu-fuzz`. The tool allows users to configure and launch fuzzing campaigns, as well as collect bb coverage statistics on the performance of these campaigns.

This tool has four helper functions which can be selected using the positional argument.

- `config`: This helper function is used to dump semu configuration for testcases.
- `launch`: This helper function is used to dump VSCode launch configurations for testcases.
- `stat`: This helper function is used to gather basic block coverage statistics and generate an image for testcases.
- `run`: This helper function is used to run afl test of testcases with nohup.

All of these helper need `base_configs` as input argument. `base_configs` is a yml file, which takes simplest settings of firmware. For more information about this configuration file, please refer to the [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

Options:

- `-h`, `--help`: Displays the help message and exits
- `-a`, `--afl`: Just for helper launch. If set, enable the dumping of vscode launch with AFL.
- `-s`, `--syms`: Just for helper config. If set, enable symbols table extract. (This arg is not recommended. Recommend using ida_dump_symbols.py to dump syms)
- `-t DURATION`, `--duration DURATION`: Just for helper stat. The duration of AFL execution, the default value is 24, which means 24 hours.

## Simple Demo

This repository provides a simple test case that you can use to verify the proper installation of `semu-fuzz` and `semu-fuzz-helper`, and test their basic functionality. If you want to re-run our experiments, you can replace this testcase and configuration file with our [unit-test](https://github.com/MCUSec/SEmu/tree/main/DataSet/p2im-unit-tests) and [fuzzing-test](https://github.com/MCUSec/SEmu/tree/main/DataSet/fuzz_tests) simples.

1. Dump `semu_config` file:
    ```bash
    semu-fuzz-helper config samples/base_configs.yml
    ```

2. Use `semu-fuzz` to debug with debug level 3:
    ```bash
    semu-fuzz samples/base_inputs/sample1.bin samples/semu_config.yml -d 3
    ```
    If the execution is successful, you will see the debugging information in the `samples/debug_output` directory.

3. Use `semu-fuzz-helper` to generate a vscode launch file:
    ```bash
    semu-fuzz-helper launch samples/base_configs.yml
    ```
    If the execution is successful, you will see a new `launch.json` file generated in the `samples/` directory.
